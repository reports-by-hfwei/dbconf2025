<p><strong>Key Trends and Insights:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shift towards black-box verification:</strong> Works such as Plume, Vbox and IsoRel build on the idea of black-box testing, where the checker only observes transaction inputs and outputs. These tools use sophisticated dependency tracking (vector clocks, tree clocks or dependency graphs) to detect anomalies and support complex SQL operations in relational DBMSs【741389624480861†L259-L276】【917122697200702†L172-L191】.</li>
<li><strong>Formal verification of protocols:</strong> Protocol-oriented research like VerIso and Eiger-PORT+ applies formal methods to prove that concurrency control protocols satisfy strict serializability or strong causal consistency. These works model realistic protocols in theorem provers and reveal subtle bugs in widely used protocols like TAPIR【601857494417423†L49-L62】【253534846932426†L84-L100】.</li>
<li><strong>Complexity analysis and algorithm design:</strong> The CAV 2025 paper highlights the computational hardness of verifying mixed isolation levels and proposes efficient algorithms for practical cases【296729877842262†L61-L72】. Such complexity analyses guide tool designers to focus on tractable subclasses.</li>
<li><strong>Client-program and robustness verification:</strong> Recent efforts go beyond database internals to ensure that client applications remain correct under weak isolation or memory models. Dynamic robustness verification for weak memory models and TxnSails’ adaptive isolation level selection illustrate this trend【633860105723204†L49-L63】【747100117477040†L12-L29】.</li>
<li><strong>Empirical studies and bug analysis:</strong> Large-scale studies of transaction bugs provide valuable insights into common error patterns and inform the design of testing tools. <em>Understanding Transaction Bugs in Database Systems</em> and Troc contribute extensive datasets and detection approaches【135599895351687†L410-L421】【978953426573862†L423-L440】.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the frontier of transaction consistency verification in 2025 is characterised by a combination of formal verification, black-box testing, adaptive scheduling techniques and empirical studies. These developments point toward more comprehensive tools that can verify complex isolation levels across heterogeneous DBMSs and help developers reason about transactional correctness in modern applications.</p>
